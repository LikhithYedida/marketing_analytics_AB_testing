📊 Marketing Analytics & Customer Segment Performance Dashboard
A Real-World Data Analysis Project Using Google Sheets, Pivot Tables & Visualization

This project demonstrates how a Data Analyst investigates real-world marketing performance, identifies high-value customer segments, and provides actionable business insights using only spreadsheets, pivot tables, and data storytelling.

The dataset simulates multi-channel marketing performance — including revenue, acquisition cost, engagement, profit margin, and clicks across various customer segments and marketing channels.

🔍 Business Problem

A retail marketing team wants to understand:

Which customer segments generate the highest revenue?

Which marketing channels are most cost-efficient?

Are engagement scores consistent across segments?

Which segment delivers the strongest ROI?

How should budget be reallocated to maximize performance?

The challenge is to turn a large raw dataset into clear, data-driven insights and build a live dashboard that helps leadership make decisions.

🎯 Objective

Build a Customer Segment Performance Dashboard that shows:

✔ Revenue by Customer Segment
✔ Acquisition Cost by Channel
✔ Revenue vs Acquisition Cost
✔ Clicks by Segment
✔ Engagement Score by Segment
✔ Key KPI Summary
✔ Insights & Recommendations
✔ Segment-level filters

This mirrors real marketing analytics work performed in industry.

🛠️ Tools Used

Google Sheets (Pivot Tables, Charts, Slicers, Dashboard formatting)

Excel (KPI tables, calculations, layout design)

Data Cleaning (formula-based cleaning & aggregation)

Data Visualization (bar charts, combo charts, slicers)

This project intentionally uses spreadsheet-based analytics to reflect real workflows used by marketing teams.

📈 Approach
1. Data Cleaning

Verified column formats (numeric, % margins, dates)

Removed anomalies and empty rows

Standardized marketing channel and segment names

Added calculated columns for profit margin, acquisition cost, engagement averages

2. Pivot Table Modeling

Created pivot tables to analyze:

Revenue by Customer Segment

Acquisition Cost by Marketing Channel

Clicks by Segment

Engagement Score by Segment

Revenue vs Acquisition Cost comparison

Each pivot feeds a dynamic chart on the dashboard.

3. KPI Metrics

Calculated essential performance KPIs:

Total Revenue

Total Acquisition Cost

Average Profit Margin

Total Clicks

Top Performing Segment

4. Dashboard Creation

Designed a professional-grade dashboard with:

Interactive slicers for Channel & Segment

Clean layout, consistent visuals

Insight summary box

Comparison charts for multi-metric storytelling

📊 Key Findings (Insights Summary)

Foodies are the highest-performing segment across revenue & clicks

Engagement scores remain consistent across all segments (5.48–5.51)

Google Ads has the highest acquisition cost but also strong click volume

Profit margin stays steady at 0.77 across segments

Organic/social channels (YouTube, Instagram) show strong ROI efficiency

These findings support budget optimization decisions in real marketing analytics scenarios.

💡 Business Recommendations

Increase investment in Foodies & Tech Enthusiasts — highest revenue & click performance.

Review Google Ads efficiency — cost is high relative to ROI.

Strengthen Website & Email campaigns — consistent engagement with lower acquisition cost.

Run tailored A/B tests on low-performing segments to boost conversions.

Focus on high-ROI channels like YouTube & Email before scaling paid ads.
